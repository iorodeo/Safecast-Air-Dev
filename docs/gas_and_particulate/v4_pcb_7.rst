Teensy Headers
================================

Use the pairs of 5-position, 7-pos and 13-pos female headers in the kit to build up a Teensy header on the board. 

* Start with one of the 5-pos headers. Use wire clippers to cut off the second pin leg (this is not shown in the image). 
* Place this onto the board and solder in place. 
* Continue to build up the rest of the headers using the images below as a guide.
* These female headers will be used to connect the Teensy later in the instructions.
