* Solder the 6-pin and 4-pin into positions U4 and U5 as shown in the image below. **Solder with the shorter pin side facing up.** These pin headers will be used to connect the OpenLog SD card data logger and Pololu 3V3 optional power regulator later in the instructions.

* Solder the 7-pin header into position U9 as shown in the image below. **Solder with the shorter pin side facing up.** This pin header will be used to connect the Adafruit temp/humidity sensor later in the instructions.
* Solder the 2-pin header into position P10. For this header, **solder with the longer pin side facing up.** This pin header can be used with a jumper to change the I2C address of the Adafruit temp/humidity sensor in the event of a conflict with an optional device on the UEXT header.
