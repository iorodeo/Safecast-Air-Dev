Headers for gas and particulate sensors
==============================================

There are 4 headers for connecting sensors to the board. **For a particulate-only board, you can skip Headers P1 and P2.** 

* P1 and P2 - Connecting the Alphasense Gas sensor headers 
* P9 - Connecting the Alphasense OPC-N2 particulate sensor 
* P3 - UEXT general purpose expansion header. Has 12C, SPI and UART. Can also be used as additional analog inputs e.g. for connecting methane sensor.
